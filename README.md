# Hashing-on-databases
This is an implementation of Open Addressing, Chaining and multiHashing on databases.

## Run the program

Create a c++ project in any IDE(Eclipse, VS, codeblocks, ...) and use it or use one of the following command lines on linux:

   For open addressing:
    
```
g++ main.cpp readfile.cpp openAddressing.cpp -o output
```

   For chaining:
```
g++ main.cpp readfile.cpp chaining.cpp -o output
```

   For multiple hashing:
```
g++ main.cpp readfile.cpp multipleHashing.cpp -o output
```

Note: don't forget to delete the output file before the next run for the testing purpose.
